# About me

I'm a true enthusiast of technologies, programming, engineering and system design.

My first experience was a lego robotics design and programming, and participation (and winning awards) in FLL robotics championships (incl. 2016 Open European Championship). Also, I created and maintained websites for my FLL teams. After that, I switched to the Arduino platform to design appliances and write system software for it. My interest in Arduino leads me to learn computer architecture and OS principles and low-level programming for desktop computers. 

I'm a huge fan of retro computers - collecting them and writing Assembler and C software to run on previous generations of personal and home computers.

To mention more modern technologies: I learned Python and use it daily; I created my own iOS applications using Swift; Games using own engine with C++; I learned Javascript; I have experience with React and Node.js and <a href="/article/skills">other technologies</a>.

I'm also interested in electronics, micro-electronics and the architecture of computer systems. 

In addition to regular everyday sports activities, I like practical shooting and - as a member of IPSC - participating in competitions regularly. On top of that, I ran a D&D club in my school to have a great time with my schoolmates. My friends find me a nice,  open and honest person they can rely on.

Hope, now you know me a bit better. :)
