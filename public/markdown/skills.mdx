## More details

### JavaScript

All of my websites make heavy use of JavaScript and React.js.

I know basics of EcmaScript 6 standart's features.

### Stylesheets

I personally use more of Sass, but can easily read and write stylesheets using plain CSS or SCSS

### React.js

I chose React.js for it's modernity and ease of use, which is obtained by consistend and logical design and well-written documentation.

### Next.js

This website is written with Next.js, and havily relies on it's static webpage generation capabilities. If I will need to update any of this website's contents I can just modify one of markdown files and on the next request changes will be live.

### Node.js

I decided to stick to it because it enables me to write backend quickly and without learning new technologies, such as PHP.

### Python 3

I use Python mainly for automation and scripting, and I know basics of backend development with Flask.

It allows for more flexibility than Node.js and access to many OS-level features, such as raw internet sockets or Linux kernel calls.

### English

Understanding of C1 level texts and speech, experience in writing and reading technical articles and documentation about both programming and other fields.

### Self-education

Most of my programming knowledge is self-taught by books and online resources. I can get a grip on new technology or principle in short period of time, without sacrificing quality of resulting knowledge.

### Git

I know and can use basic features of git, such as branching, push/pull requests and merging.
However my experience in Git is not as extensive as I would like it to be, but I am always ready to learn new things and skills. 

### Architectures and operating systems

In the past years I became interested in computer architectures and operating systems. I like to do low-level development as a hobby, mainly using C and assembly language.
